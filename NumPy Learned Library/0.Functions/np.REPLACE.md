NumPy itself does not have a direct replace function like pandas does for DataFrames. 
However, you can achieve similar functionality using NumPy's array operations. 
One common method is to use boolean indexing with NumPy's where function or simple array operations to replace values in an array.



```python
import numpy as np

# Sample NumPy array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 2])

# Replace all instances of 2 with 20
arr[arr == 2] = 20

print(arr)
```

In this example, arr == 2 creates a boolean mask that identifies all elements in the array that are equal to 2.
We then use this mask to index into the array and assign a new value (20) to those positions.


```python
# Using np.where to replace values
arr = np.where(arr == 3, 30, arr)

print(arr)
```
